# Log Watcher

Log Watcher is an extension for VSCode to watch logs and display them in the "Output" tab, much like what `tail -F` does.

## Features

Features

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

This extension is tailored for development of [WordPress VIP](https://docs.wpvip.com/) with [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.wpvip.com/technical-references/developing-with-github-codespaces/). While the "Watch File" command will work everywhere, more specialized commands like "Watch nginx access.log" expect to find the log files in the preconfigured places.

### Installation

1. Run [`Install Extension`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_install-an-extension) command from the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/codebasics#_command-palette).
2. Search and choose `Log Watcher`.

## Changelogs
